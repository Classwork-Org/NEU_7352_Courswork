## TODO (3)
1. drystone/drystone.c:131   (1) Change the loop counter here by passing it as arg from argv (must cast string to long)
2. drystone/gprofExplode:3   (2) pass all data with more accuracy depending on compiler to data folder
3. drystone/gprofExplode:4   (2) Vary loop iterations after before running multiple times
